## DO NOT

### Donâ€™t use section as a wrapper for styling. 

`section` is not a wrapper, a semantic section help construct a document outline. 

### Don't over use header. 

`header` represents introductory or navigations

### Not every image is a figure. 

Your logo is not a figure. Figure can be more than an image
