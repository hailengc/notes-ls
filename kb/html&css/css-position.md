Position
================

## relative: to its normal flow

## absolute : to its first parent with relative position

> absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow. This means you can put it anywhere, and it wonâ€™t affect or be affected by any other element in the flow. 

> absolute elements create a new coordinate system for child elements. 


## fixed - always there
e.g. footer always shows on the bottom, notifications
