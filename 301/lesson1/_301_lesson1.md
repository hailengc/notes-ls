### Worldwind tour of a Rails app and basic scaffolding.

How Rails MVC handles processing a request and issuing a response.
  ![rails mvc](./request_response_mvc.jpg)

- bunlder, create sandbox per gemfile/project. 
  // bundle exec rake db:migrate ->  the specific version that your project depends on
  // rake db:migrate ->  the system level version
  // gemfile.lock

- files the rails new created
  - config/dababase.yml default is sqlite3 for dev, postgram for production
  - gemfile -> project file, whate gems I need
  - gemfile.loc -> generated when run bundle install
  - **routes.rb** -> routing 

- folder
  - app
    - asset (static asset, css,js,images,...)
    - **controller**
    - mailers -> not needed, but need a email provider
    - **models** -> 
    - **views** -> erb templates
  - bin -> where executabe sits, we never touch it
  - config
    - environments - first class in rails - override the appliation.rb
    - initializers -> be init before everything else
    - locales -> in yml files
  - boot.rb -> never touch, rails to boot itself
  - environment.rb -> 
  - db
    - migrate
  - lib 
    - asset > static asset
    - task
  - log
  - public
    - generic error pages,  static asset
    - robots.txt -> for search engine
  - test
  - tmp, cache,...
  - vendor > not really need, use bundler
  - config.ru x
  - rakefile x

**generator is not for experenced developers, build yourself**

`rake routes` to show all routes or `http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes`

    ```
    D:\DEVEL\GitHub\notes-ls\301\pre\myapp>rake routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern               Controller#Action
        posts GET    /posts(.:format)          posts#index
              POST   /posts(.:format)          posts#create
    new_post GET    /posts/new(.:format)      posts#new
    edit_post GET    /posts/:id/edit(.:format) posts#edit
        post GET    /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#show
              PATCH  /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#update
              PUT    /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#update
              DELETE /posts/:id(.:format)      posts#destroy  
  ```

controller/action -> render the view (name match)


### ActiveRecord 1:M

Active Record Pattern: how to abstract from database table into code. Object Relational Mapping (ORM). Rails impl the ORM in ruby

*OO -> SQL*

**foreign key** is always in the many side, occurs repeated

in `rails console`, `Post.first` translate into sql statement
```bash
irb(main):001:0> Post.first
  Post Load (0.0ms)  SELECT  "posts".* FROM "posts"  ORDER BY "posts"."id" ASC LIMIT 1
=> #<Post id: 1, title: "This is a post", url: "http://avcavc.com", description: "generated by rails controller, amazing...", created_at: "2017-04-20 23:55:46", updated_at: "2017-04-20 23:55:46">
```

> Exceptions: Save user info may save into different tables in different database, doesn't fit

controller
- plural

model
- singular

view
- controller as folder name
- action as file name

- irb with all active record loaded

association
```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end
```
- in many side: `has_many :posts`
- in 1 side: `belongs_to :user`
- virtual attributes, getter/setters for columns

- in memory object: id is nill
- in database: sql generated, begin/commit transaction, has id
