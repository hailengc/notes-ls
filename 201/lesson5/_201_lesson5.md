- Border Collapse

> The border-collapse property determines a tableâ€™s border model. There are three values for the border-collapse property: collapse, separate, and inherit. By default, the border-collapse property value is separate, meaning that all of the different borders will stack up next to one another, as described above. The collapse property, on the other hand, condenses the borders into one, choosing the table cell as the primary border.

```css
/* border collapse */
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
th,
td {
  border: 1px solid #cecfd5;
  padding: 10px 15px;
}

/* border seperate with spacing */
table {
  border-collapse: separate;
  border-spacing: 4px;
}
table,
th,
td {
  border: 1px solid #cecfd5;
}
th,
td {
  padding: 10px 15px;
}
```

> Code Review by Victor Paolo Reyes (TA)
> the semantic meaning of the element
> A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.
> The div element has no special meaning at all.
