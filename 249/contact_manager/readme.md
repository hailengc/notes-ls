Here's a practice project that you can use to prepare for the real take home project and the interview.

Implement the Contact Manager app here:

http://devsaran.github.io/contact-manager-backbone/

- You should implement all the features there, including the search. 
- In addition, also implement a "tagging" feature, which allows you to 
  - create tags, such as "marketing", "sales", "engineering", 
  - and when you add/edit a contact, you can select a tag to attach to the contact. - Finally, you can click on a tag and show all the contacts with that tag. 
  - The UI isn't too important here, but focus on the functionality.

Review some of the course material and projects if you get stuck, and feel free to play with **object creation patterns** that we covered in the last lesson. The real take home project is more advanced than this project, and you're expected to complete it within 48 hours. So please only proceed when you feel comfortable with this project.
