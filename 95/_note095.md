    + written in C: Linux Kernal, many web server, Python, PHP, and Perl
   
    + C - machine things, SmallTalk (Object Oriented) - human things
   
    + SmallTalk: 
      - Java: ST virtual machine, 
      - ObjC: C+ST, 
      - C#: C+Java
      - C++: Object Oritented C
   
    + Python - Glue, multiparadigm, fir C but a bit hard to connect to Java
      - Jython for Java
      - IronPython for .Net
      - e.g. Instagram 
   
    + Technical Debt
   
    + Bank loves Cobel
   
    +  Lisp" nutshell, think in tree
   
    + database
      - free: PostgreSQL and MySQL, SQLite
   
    + Java:  A language for building great big things for great big places with great big teams.
   
    + Microsoft:
   
    + Clojure, which is … a Lisp. That is, Clojure takes a much-adored computer language that was born in the 1950s, updates it for the 2010s, and gives that language the ability to reuse all the Java classes in the world.
   
    + NodeJS: In 2009 a developer named Ryan Dahl modified the V8 engine, which was free software, and made it run outside the browser. freestanding versions of JavaScript
   
    + PHP: Personal Home Page. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, for God’s sake. WordPress. PHP. I don’t wish it any harm. I’m glad to see how well it’s done for itself. We had some good times together. I just don’t ever want to go back there.

    + App: 

    + Framework: Django in Python

    + Debugging

    + Testing: best tested code - SQLite

    + Version Control

      - Enterprise - Microsoft or Java, need product knowledge

    - Advice
      + pick profit center

    - How to - job hunting process
      + code sample, small, 1 or 2 files with test
      + make sure commit clear description
      + use branch
      + be prepared with your code
      + attending meetup, don't lead with job, use technical question to startup conversation.
      + help others
      + contribute to open source, focusing on one. event documentation is good.
      + Do not be too opinionated, no bad, love, hate, like
      + build and ship, your URL as your profile, show architecture 
      + know your FUNDAMENTALS well
      + is about solving problems
