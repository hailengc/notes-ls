// Sentiment Analysis 1

// Sentiment analysis or sometimes also known as opinion mining is an approach to determine subjective information in a text and convert it into something more concrete. For example, we may derive based on keywords used in the text whether the mood was positive, negative or neutral.

// The use of sentiment analysis adds a dimension of data to content that is mostly text based. Its basic task is classifying the polarity of given sentence, text, or document. In this exercise, we will build something similar and simpler.

// There are lots of ways to implement a sentiment analysis. For this exercises, we will come up with two sets of arrays for words and do a keyword-based approach. The first of two arrays will contain words that connote a "positive" sentiment, while the second a "negative". Given the number of positive and negative words, the sentiment score can be computed as the difference between the count of the two. If the positive score is greater than the negative, then sentiment is positive. If positive is less than negative then the sentiment is negative. If the two are equal, then the sentiment is neutral.

// Implement a function that takes a text as an argument and returns whether it had a positive, negative, or neutral disposition, given sets of positive and negative words.

// Excerpt of text taken from Wikipedia article comparing different versions of "To be, or not to be".

// Thinking in Abstractions

// Our solution should take the shape of a filter, where we'll filter the text down to an array of positive words, and an array of negative words. From there, we'll produce the output easily.

// The list of words can be gotten by executing this statement with regex:

// var wordList = text.toLowerCase().replace(/\n/g, ' ').replace(/[\.\!\,\?]/g, '').split(' ');
// The above statement converts all the characters to lowercase, replace all the new line characters with spaces, removes special characters (.,!?), splits the text in words, and stores it in the variable wordList.
