210 - Lesson 3 : Exercises: Logic and Flow Control
====================================

# 1	Chrome Developer Tools

## Tips
- PAUSE on exception
- Console as runtime js environment

- Async call stack provide better visibility

- proper name ease the debuger

## 

Source break
- embedded `debuger;` 
- toggle to break

DOM break: 
- right click on tag
- select break on ...


XHR break (XMLHttpRequest)
- XMLHttpRequest or XHR is a javascript API used for communication between the client and the server
- part of AJAX

Event break

Async Call Stack
the async call stack feature provides increased visibility into the full call stack of asynchronous functions.

Blackbox

Live editing

- CTRL + S to resume the debuger
- changes patch to Browser only not original file

# 3	Odd Numbers

To test whether a number is odd, you can use the remainder operator. 

# 4	Multiples of 3 and 5

Q: How to determine whether an integer is a multiple of a number?

A number is a multiple of 3 if the remainder when divided by 3 is 0; it is a multiple of 5 if the remainder when divided by 5 is 0. In JavaScript, you can test this using the remainder operato

# 5	Print Multiples

This solution must step through every number between 100 and 0. Alternatively, you can determine the number's largest multiple that is less than 100, then start the loop with that multiple. With each iteration of the loop, you can decrement the number by the argument; when the result is negative, you can quit.

As above, we must check each multiple to determine whether it is odd. If it is odd, we log it.

# 6	FizzBuzz

In this exercise, you must loop through the integers 1 to 100, inclusive. For each number, check whether it is a multiple of 3, 5, or both, then log the appropriate number or string. Pay attention to the order of your checks, and be mindful that your loop includes both 1 and 100.
