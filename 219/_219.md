Interview Study Guide
=========================

This interview is going to assess your skills of basic JavaScript programming and problem solving skills. Please take time to prepare for the interview with the study guide below. See Assessment Rules for the policy on retakes.

# Here is a list of JavaScript specific topics that you need to study on:

- Language syntax, types and flow control
- Functions, variables and scopes
- Arrays and objects
- Language built-in methods on String and Array
- Mutability of values and objects
- Pure functions and side effects
- Regular expressions (what's covered in our book)

- "210 - Small Problems" 
  + practice solving problems to prepare for the interview. 
  + The interview question is going to be around, or more challenging than the "medium" level exercises.
  + [x] at least 30-50 exercises - all done     

# Here is a list of general problem solving topics that you're expected to demonstrate in the interview:

- Be able to build and communicate a clear plan towards solving a given problem
- Fluent with JavaScript's built-in list processing abstractions and higher order functions
- Be able to write code that follow clear and idiomatic abstractions
- Be able to validate assumptions, debug issues and fix any problems
- Good code style

# General communication and presence

- Think, speak and code delibrately
- Accuracy in concepts and terminologies
- Stay calm


# The General Approach for Problem Solving

We're going to run two sessions on a general approach for solving small, interview style code challenges.

> Part 1
>
> where we focused on how to understand the requirements and generate examples / test cases:
>
> language independent

## Small Code Challenge Problems
- 20 - 45 minutes
- typical solutions: 10-40 LOC (line of code)
- used extensively in interviews for a reason
  - mastery on a language *not only this*
  - logic / reasoning *but also the way you break down problems*
  - communications
- not a skill that you "acquire and file away", but needs a lot of **practice**
- *to filter out too 10% candidates* 
- *engineering focused companies*

## Understand the Problem
- *>50%*
- *break down*

- requirements are explicit (*explicit*)
  - take notes.
  - the odd words problem *see example*

- requirements are not so explicit and need to be modeled (*not so explicit*)
  - examples need to be described in computational words 
  - diamond of stars
  - *questions are described as examples not words*
  - *transform example to descriptions*
  - *the given examples are not enough, should always expand to cover edge / boundaryy / invalid cases*

- implicit knowledge needs to be captured (*implicit*)
  - convert to explicit rules, in computational language
  - what century is that *see example*

- identifying and defining important terms and concepts
  - queen attack
  - same row; same column; esp. same diagnal

- **ask questions to verify your understanding!** 
  - during *break down* and *write text cases*

## Examples / Test Cases
- Input / Output
  - *list of possible input and the output*

- Test cases serve two purposes:
  - help you understand the problem
  - allow you to verify your solution *how do you know you are done*
  - *go thru the break down, write the text cases down*

- **happy paths** 
  - *focus on this first*
  - combination of requirements; the "obvious" result

- **Edge cases** 
  - focus on input
  - emptiness (`nil/null, "", [], {}`) *ask if needed*
  - boundary conditions *20 is boundary*
  - upper case / lower case *whenever coding on string*
  - repetition / duplication 
  - data types

- **Failures / Bad Input**
  - raise exceptions / report errors *ask if needed*
  - return a special value (`nil/null, 0, "", [] etc`)

- **ask questions to verify your understanding!**

## Q&A
- Try communicate more as much as possible
- First part is always understand the problem and break it down to smaller prolblems
- Big ones trend to use language independent algo, write from scratch
- Small ones focus one problem solving with the tools they use
- Big risk: spend time on wrong direction, break down could ensure you are in the right paths
- Understanding problem / breaking down is not language specific. It is above language level. 
- Language is like a building blocks, which is different from language to language.

> Part 2
>
> where we focused on data structure, algorithms and abstractions:
>
> JavaScript in specific

## Data Structure

- input data
- rules/requirements as data
  - hash / object

- string, array, hash/object, number

  - string
    - concat, strip, reverse, etc
    - Regular Expression! split, replace, match...

  - array
    - need to walk through it (iteration)
    - index
    - **abstractions!!**
      - map // to a new array
      - reduce // to a single value
      - select/filter // to a subset 
      - all
      - ...

  - hash/object
    - lookup table / dictionary
    - partition data for more efficient access downstream
    - digest

  - number
    - math operations
    - **number as string** may have advantage over numbers

- compound data structures
  - array of arrays
  - hash with array/object values, etc

## Algorithm

- Algorithms have to be described **in the language of chosen data structure!**
  - "then solve it" doesn't count
- Have to be really fluent with
  - String / Regex
  - Array
    - Ruby: Enumerable
    - JavaScript: Higher Order Functions
  - Hash / Object
    - Creation (default values)
    - Access (default values)
    - Iteration

- verify your algorithm with your examples / test cases **check point before coding**

## Abstraction

- Very important, *rely on language* built in abstractions: String/Regex, Array, Hash/Object

- Avoid solving big problems!
  - **Always, always, break bigger problems into smaller problems**
  - Don't try to walk through a wall

- lay out the general steps of an algorithm, without having to go to details
  - **Try to solve a problem in 1-2 sentences!!!**
  - If you can't, raise your abstraction
    - create helper methods/functions
    - push detailed steps to methods/functions

## Interview Tips
- Communicative
- Getting to a working solution >> no solution
- De-risking
  - Spend time on completely wrong direction
  - Check your building blocks
    - run code often
    - debug locally
- Manage your energy
